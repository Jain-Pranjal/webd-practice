    <p>so basically the client makes a request to the server by using the browser and the server will fetch all 3 things and make a response to the browser back and then it will make the website available to to client </p>
    <p>backened means that how the procssing is done on the sever means how the server will give the response to the user by doing various thing on the server </p>
    <h1>making a bookmark website </h1>
    <p>here we can make multiple bookmark to go to that section of the website</p>
    <p>for makig the bookmark just u need to use the # by id and link with anchor tag </p>
    <p>if i am giving some requst to the server than taht requesr is doine by the js like the autocomplete thing in youtube is done by js </p>
    <div id="first">
        <h2>first heading </h2>
    </div>
<br>
    <p>we include the script js inside the body tage and beofre thre closing tag bof the body</p>
    <br><br><br><br><
    <a href="#first">go to the first</a>

    <!-- we can have the script tag inside the head tag or above the closing tag of the body tag also  -->

    <!-- form is the thing in which we submit the data from the client to the server and for that we use the form   -->

<form action="submit.php" method="get">
    enter name <input type="text" autofocus>
    <!-- we can use the autofocus to focus on the box when we reload the website anytime  -->
    <!-- in this way we can autofocus the input tag whenervr we reload the website -->
</form>

<!-- the action attribute specifies the page url where the form data should be sent after the submission  -->





    <br>
    <p style="background-color: yellow;color: red;">here we inlcude the script.js before the body tag </p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>

<!-- basically we can link the scipt tag either in the head tag or before the end of the bodytag -->

   <p>
       in the video tag we can use the poster attribute which will behave as the thumbnail of the video 
   </p>

   to use the svg image in the img tag we need to import some declaration in it 
   avaialble on the stack overflow as svg is an xml format 
   <h3>to embed a map using the iframe tag</h3>
   
   <audio src="#" preload="none"></audio>
   <video src="#" poster="thumbnail of the video as the poster "></video>

   <div>
    <h3>Web core vitals </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CLS it is known as the cumulative layput shift which means that our webpage should have the least CLs in orde for the change of the webpage</li>
        <li>LCP largest contentful paint means that howl much time is needed for the largest element to load on the page</li>
        <li>FID means the first input delay </li>
    </ul>
   </div>

   <div>
    so keep in mind that we need to keep the CLS as less as possible so that it wont shift the page 
   </div>
   <br>
   <div>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="#">home</a></p></li>
        <li>about</li>
        <li>help</li>
        <li>contact</li>
    </ul>
   </div>

<!-- so it is advisable to use thr generic fonts becoz if the font is not available then we can use the generic fonts  -->

<!-- git course  -->
<!-- to find all the file either hidden use the git ls -a


origin is the name of the repo to which all the changes move to github 
basically it is the name of th eremote repo 
we can also change the name of the branch 
git branch -m old new 

if we are working wiht the same repo and pushin it agaiujn and agaain then we can use the git push -u origin main 

it is said that we should do the cloning first from the remote and then we should do the changes 
also when we clone the repo into the folder then it is already been tracked by the git as we have clone it from the github 

so we need to make sure the work flow that first we need to make the repo on the github and then we can make he clone it on the computer and then make the commit on it by pushing it 


we can file the pr in the same repo as we can create multiple bracnhes for it so we need to merge them by making a  pr

git checkout -b name 


to delete a bracnh we need to move to first other branch 

origin is the link where all the repo are hold and it is remote as wehad link to our local system


so basically we can creaet a new bracnh and we can merge it by raising a PR
