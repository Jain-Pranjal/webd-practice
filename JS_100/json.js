// json is the lightweight file that is used to transefer the information across the web easily 
// morover the json is wriiten in the string format only 
// and json is in the key value pair 

// nowdays 99% api returs the repsonse int he form fo json which is just similar to js object with the key and value pair 
// so we can convert any json into js object and vice versa 

JSON.stringify()
// it converts the js object into the json 

JSON.parse()
// it convetts the json inot the object 

// json is in the string fornat only which is in the "" 
// also we need to use only the "" in making the json 


// insode the json we can use any datatype in it but it should only be in the key value pair 

// inside json anydataye can be used but the format of the json is only the string 
// so we can pass the object array anything in the json in the key value pair only 

// usign the parse it convetts into the js object
